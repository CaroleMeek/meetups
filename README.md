# Meetups
Here you can find the slides/examples/etc. from the talks.

# How to create a folder?
If you had a talk/presentation/demo on one of our meetups, then please leave your stuff for the others here.
So create a folder named like following pattern `meetup-yyyy-MM-dd` and put your stuff inside.

Subfolders like `slides` or `examples` are very welcome.

Thanks!
